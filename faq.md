## Why are there only Jupyter Notebooks in this repository?

Jupyter notebooks offer a great way to interactively code and see instantly as to what we are doing. The author loves jupyter notebooks hence the choice. These notebooks are for educational purposes only. Our experiments are relatively small scale and can be run in a reasonable amount of time in a notebook. However, readers who wish to build deployment ready systems should bear in mind that they have to do many other things than just run an algorithm in a jupyter notebook.

## How to preprocess data for RUL prediction problems?

Data preprocessing methods are problem specific and depends on how data are stored. The data preprocessing method used in this project may not work for your dataset. There is no universal data preprocessing method that would work for all RUL prediction problems. So, depending on the data format and problem definition, you may have to use your own data preprocessing method. That might be a modified version of the code used in this project or completely different.
